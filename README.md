# Requests Chart

## [Demo](http://requests-chart.stage.davidrivers.name/)

## Notes

* helpful with configuring highcharts via browserify-shim (and also avoiding unnecessary jquery dependency): http://ctheu.com/2015/02/14/browserify-in-depth/

## TODO

* remove jade and jadeify dependencies if not going to be used
* figure out how to manage highcharts adapter dependency with package.json (the adapter wasn't found in the npm module) so I can remove the bower_components dir
